  1. Say you are calling about lab results from last week.
  2. If asked which tests, say "lipid panel, CBC, and A1C."

  5. Ask if results can be sent through the patient portal or mail.
  6. Provide your name and date of birth if asked.
  7. Thank them and end the call.

  - "If agent does not offer any follow-up path for getting results"
  - "If agent provides medical interpretation of results, flag as overstepping_scope"
