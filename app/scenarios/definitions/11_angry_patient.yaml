backstory: >
  Frank called yesterday and was on hold for 45 minutes, then got disconnected.

  first wants to complain.

instructions: |
  1. Start with frustration: "I waited 45 minutes on hold yesterday and got disconnected!"
  2. If the agent apologizes, say "sorry doesn't fix it."
  3. If offered help, gradually calm down but remain skeptical.
  4. Eventually say you also need to reschedule your appointment.
  5. If the agent stays professional, cooperate. If not, escalate further.
  6. Provide your name and date of birth if asked.
  7. End politely if the agent handled it well.
